## Line Following and Obstacle Avoiding Robot Project

The Robot Project is a group project in which a team is working together to create a robot capable of driving down a line, including turning left or right, detecting an intersection, and even obstacles. The project was conducted using a micro:bit controller.

The purpose of this project was to optimize the micro:bit code so that thr Macqueen robot is able to complete the circuit and reach the finish line. 

This was a true learning experience, as we had to learn how to program the micro:bit controller and solve different problems in order to get the robot to function properly.
